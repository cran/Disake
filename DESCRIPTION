Description: Discrete smoothing of probability mass function is performed using three discrete associated kernels: Dirac Discrete Uniform (DiracDU), Binomial and Discrete Triangular. Two automatic bandwidth selection procedures are implemented: the cross-validation method for the three kernels and the local Bayesian approach for Binomial kernel. Note that DiracDU is used for categorical data, Binomial kernel is appropriate for count data with small or moderate sample sizes, and Discrete Triangular kernel is recommended for count data with large sample sizes.
